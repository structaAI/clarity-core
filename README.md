# ClarityCore: The Future of Denoising and Super-Resolution

This is the official ClarityCore Repository

ClarityCore (Auth-SwinDiff) is a research-grade Generative AI engine developed at Structa AI Labs. It utilizes a hierarchical Swin-Transformer backbone combined with a novel PSWA (Phase-Shift Window Attention) Bridge to achieve superior scaling efficiency and high-frequency detail recovery in image restoration tasks.

Successfully managed to develop and test the VAE and SwinDiT part

Now Onto The Gaussian Noise Scheduler.
